  - I just learned that the popup is limited to 800x600 and doesn't seem to be able to be centered
  - I'm just trying to decide if I want the figure out how to make the svelte app get injected on page instead of be in the popup. Maybe the popup should just be for getting to settings or something. 
  - If it gets injected into the page, I don't think it could talk back to the main extension scripts, so that would be problematic unless there's an API to have them sort of talk to each other with some kind of signal.
  - Might not be worth it and to just make it in the corner.
